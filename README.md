#  Sign Language Translator

A machine learning project that recognizes American Sign Language (ASL) alphabets from hand gesture images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This helps bridge communication gaps for individuals who rely on sign language.

##  How It Works

1. Preprocesses image data into grayscale 28x28 pixel format.
2. Trains a CNN model on labeled ASL hand gesture images.
3. Predicts the alphabet corresponding to a given image.
4. Optional interface: GUI or web-based app for live/demo predictions.
